# Changelog

Notable changes to Claude Code Usage Monitor are documented here, newest first.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), with
changes grouped into Added, Changed, Fixed, and Removed where applicable.

## [2.15.14] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Refresh expired Antigravity OAuth access tokens using metadata from the installed client and retry rejected access once, without rewriting provider credentials. Preserve retryable network, rate-limit, server, and malformed-response failures instead of pausing polling as a login error. Add authentication regression tests. ([#139](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/139))

## [2.15.13] - 2026-09-24

### Changed

- Expand tray-snapping regression coverage across 100%, 125%, 150%, 200%, and 300% display scaling, checking the existing 67% attach and 45% detach overlap thresholds. Document why overlap ratios keep snapping DPI independent. ([#138](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/138))

## [2.15.12] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Reuse derived Builder catalogue entries while refreshing live clock values, and rebuild for changed usage, accounts, limits, layout, language, or syntax. Avoid duplicate unchanged-draft validation and revalidate changed drafts before Apply, with cache and validation regression tests. ([#137](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/137))

## [2.15.11] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Apply tray-avoidance clamping only to runtime taskbar placements created by dragging, preserving exact authored theme positions. Keep the runtime flag out of saved themes and cover horizontal, vertical, floating, and serialized placements. ([#136](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/136))

## [2.15.10] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Cap stored Retry-After cooldowns at 24 hours for numeric and HTTP-date headers, including overflowing values, so malformed server delays cannot block accounts indefinitely. Cover boundary values, bounded timers, and request resumption after expiry. ([#135](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/135))

## [2.15.9] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Retain Builder search focus after Enter insertion while preserving the editor caret. Prevent Enter with no matching entries from causing a delayed insertion when results return, with regression coverage for repeated insertion, search typing, and empty results. ([#134](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/134))

## [2.15.8] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Keep Claude Messages usage probes reading fresh utilization and reset headers during Retry-After cooldowns, without recording probe cooldowns or bypassing ordinary request protection. Add middleware and repeated HTTP-probe regression tests. ([#133](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/133))

## [2.15.7] - 2026-09-24

### Changed

- Update sha2 to 0.11.0 and its supporting crates for release-download verification and credential-isolated Retry-After request keys. ([#132](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/132))

## [2.15.6] - 2026-09-24

### Changed

- Update Lucide icons to 1.47.0 and regenerate the compact bundled icon font from the icons used by the application. ([#131](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/131))

## [2.15.5] - 2026-09-24

### Changed

- Update dirs to 7.0.0 while preserving the home, roaming configuration, and local data directory lookups used for credentials and updates. ([#130](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/130))

## [2.15.4] - 2026-09-24

### Changed

- Update the build-time TOML parser to 1.1.6+spec-1.1.0 for locale parsing and validation. ([#129](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/129))

## [2.15.3] - 2026-09-24

### Changed

- Update ureq to 3.4.2 and ureq-proto to 0.6.4, retaining Windows certificate-store verification, HTTPS restrictions, timeouts, and Retry-After handling. ([#128](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/128))

## [2.15.2] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Update the egui/eframe family and default fonts to 0.36.2, refreshing the vendored egui-winit crate while preserving native text clipboard support and excluding image clipboard codecs. ([#127](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/127))

## [2.15.1] - 2026-09-24

### Changed

- Update checkout to v7, GitHub release publishing to v3, and .NET setup to v6 while retaining the existing release and dependency-security workflow behavior. ([#126](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/126))

## [2.15.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- Unified Theme Studio Builder for expressions, text templates, mouse actions, and context-menu actions, with a shared catalogue, search, category and provider filters, provider marks, and in-use indicators. Values and functions can be inserted at the cursor in action expressions. ([#122](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/122))

### Changed

- Updated Builder labels and entry points across all supported locales.
- Documented SemVer release rules in `AGENTS.md`: minor releases reset the patch number to zero, and major releases reset both minor and patch numbers. This feature release advances from 2.14.64 to 2.15.0.

### Fixed

- Restore the editor cursor after a Builder insertion so subsequent typing follows the inserted value, with regression coverage.

## [2.14.64] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Keep widgets dropped into free taskbar space anchored independently of tray icon changes, with temporary clamping and restoration when the tray expands. Preserve tray-relative snapping and legacy placement. Exclude notification controls from app-button collision checks to prevent false undocking. ([#125](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/125))
- Keep partially overlapping app buttons eligible for collision detection, and restrict the taskbar clamp to docked surfaces so floating themes retain their placement.

### Added

- Placement and collision regression tests, plus a Windows VM tray scenario that records real notification-area changes, drag/drop placement, window parenting and screenshots.
- Ignore local development builds and scratch folders.

## [2.14.63] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- Disposable Windows 10 and Windows 11 Hyper-V test harness with VM provisioning, portable launch and update-helper scenarios, pinned public WinGet install and upgrade scenarios, taskbar variants, and evidence collection. Documented setup, checkpoints, execution, and coverage limitations. ([#124](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/124))
- Local harness checks for configuration, scenario planning, checkpoint safeguards, PowerShell parsing, and desktop bridge compilation.

### Fixed

- Require preserved desktop memory before restoring lab checkpoints, and explicitly set and verify auto-hide state for every taskbar scenario.

## [2.14.62] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- Weekly Dependabot updates for Cargo dependencies and GitHub Actions, with coupled egui crates grouped together. Added daily, pull request, and branch dependency checks using pinned cargo-audit and cargo-deny versions. ([#119](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/119))
- Dependency security policy covering advisories, licenses, dependency sources, local checks, and vendored dependency maintenance, with a documented temporary exception for the build-time unmaintained `ttf-parser` dependency.

### Changed

- Gate release builds and publishing on dependency security checks and build releases with the committed lockfile.

## [2.14.61] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Statically link the C runtime in Windows MSVC builds, including release CI, so the executable no longer requires a separate Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable installation. Documented the build configuration and continued use of built-in Windows system libraries. ([#123](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/123))

## [2.14.60] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- Contribution guidelines, a code of conduct, a private security reporting policy, and GitHub issue and pull request templates. ([#121](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/121))

### Changed

- Documented safe diagnostic sharing and linked community and security guidance from the README. Issue templates direct suspected vulnerabilities to private reporting.

## [2.14.59] - 2026-09-24

### Changed

- Updated the MIT license copyright notice to Code Zeno Pty Ltd and the year to 2026, matching the executable metadata. ([#120](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/120))

## [2.14.58] - 2026-09-23

### Changed

- Pinned local development and release CI to Rust 1.95.0, including rustfmt and Clippy for local development. Documented the toolchain selection and the files to update when upgrading Rust. ([#118](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/118))

## [2.14.57] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- Respect `Retry-After` seconds and HTTP dates on rate-limit and server-error responses across provider usage requests. Matching requests stay blocked during server cooldowns, including manual refreshes and partial polls, while other accounts can continue refreshing. Failed polls extend their retry timer to honor the server delay. ([#117](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/117))

### Added

- Regression coverage for cooldown parsing, account isolation, expiry, invalid and oversized delays, retry timer limits, and preservation of response headers before HTTP error handling.

## [2.14.56] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- Scoped the monitor's single-instance mutex to the current Windows session so separate desktop and RDP sessions can run independently, while preserving duplicate-instance detection and Explorer restart handoff within each session. ([#116](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/116))

## [2.14.55] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- Removed retired Claude 3 Haiku from Messages API usage-header probes, avoiding a guaranteed-failing request. Probes now use the low-cost `claude-haiku-4-5` alias with the existing one-token output limit. ([#115](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/115))

## [2.14.54] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- Require a directory boundary when detecting WinGet installations so portable executables in sibling folders such as `Packages-old` use the portable updater. ([#114](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/114))

### Added

- Regression coverage for WinGet installation paths, upgrade command quoting and restart conditions, and version parsing and numeric precedence under the updater's current SemVer rules.

## [2.14.53] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- Verify portable updates against the GitHub release asset's SHA-256 digest and size, limit downloads to 100 MiB, remove failed partial downloads, and recheck and lock the staged file before replacing the installed executable. ([#113](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/113))
- Select only the exact executable from the configured repository over HTTPS, reject ambiguous or invalid release metadata, and follow stable SemVer precedence without treating build metadata as a newer version.

### Added

- Updater regression tests for release selection, integrity checks, download failures, helper arguments, and Windows file locking, run before release builds. Documented the updater's verification requirements and trust boundary.

## [2.14.52] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- Automatically append Rust panic messages, source locations, and thread details to the diagnostic log even when recording is disabled, using a separate file handle to avoid the logger's mutex. Documented crash-log collection and preservation before starting a new diagnostic session. ([#112](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/112))

## [2.14.51] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- Strengthened the polling HTTPS regression test and added updater coverage using a shared local server that checks TLS handshake initiation. The previous closed-port test could pass without exercising the TLS connector. Documented why the `native-tls` feature is required for the configured Windows certificate verification.

## [2.14.50] - 2026-09-23

### Changed

- Switched theme package ZIP compression to the zlib-rs-only Deflate feature, removing the unused Zopfli encoder dependency while retaining Deflate import and export support.

## [2.14.49] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- Brand marks for every provider on the Settings page, shown beside each provider's name in the Providers section.

### Changed

- Replaced the single-glyph GitHub font with `brand-marks.ttf`, a seven-glyph companion font carrying GitHub and provider logos in the Lucide family. The embedded font includes glyph mappings, geometry guidance, and artwork attribution alongside its declaration, with regression tests for distinct codepoints and visible glyphs.

## [2.14.48] - 2026-09-23

### Removed

- Removed BMP image imports and image clipboard support while preserving native text copy, cut, and paste. A documented local `egui-winit` patch disables `arboard`'s image dependencies. The image picker and supported-format message now list PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WebP.

## [2.14.47] - 2026-09-23

### Changed

- Minified the three bundled theme JSON files at build time, reducing embedded theme data by 95,499 bytes (41.9%) while keeping the source files readable for editing. Theme source changes automatically regenerate the bundled copies.

## [2.14.46] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- Matched the automatic floating card's background and border to the Windows system theme, restoring contrast in light mode for floating and automatically undocked widgets. ([#110](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/110))

## [2.14.45] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- Grok Build usage monitoring from the signed-in CLI session in `%USERPROFILE%\.grok\auth.json`, with a `GROK_HOME` override, provider controls, and translated sign-in guidance. ([#109](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/109))
- Grok's billing-period pool on the long-window row in both built-in themes, violet gauges and tray icons, on-demand spending once used, and per-product usage bindings under `grok.limits.<product>` in Theme Studio.

### Fixed

- Limited Grok billing credential selection to xAI sign-in scopes, excluding corporate identity-provider tokens and stored API keys.
- Bounded Grok CLI version detection, supported Windows command and PowerShell shims, and ignored output from failed commands.
- Rejected overflowing Grok reset timestamps without interrupting background polling.
- Accepted bare and wrapped numeric strings in Grok credit balances, including proto3 int64 values, while rejecting invalid or non-finite amounts.
- Retried failed Grok CLI version and path detection on later polls instead of permanently caching fallback values.

## [2.13.44] - 2026-09-22

### Changed

- Rendered the dashboard GitHub link from an icon font glyph instead of an embedded SVG, so it follows the surrounding menu text colour. The mark is a 1 KB single-glyph TrueType font that joins the Lucide icon family as a fallback.

### Removed

- Dropped the `egui_extras` dependency and its `svg` feature, which existed solely to draw the GitHub logo. This removes the resvg, usvg, tiny-skia, and XML/CSS parsing stack and reduces the release executable by roughly 549 KB (7.3%).

## [2.13.43] - 2026-09-21

### Added

- Exposed Claude usage API quotas and legacy optional limits to custom themes, including named model bindings, active scoped limits, reset timers, account-specific data, and discovered values under Claude Code in the Theme Studio text and expression editors. Built-in themes and headline values remain unchanged. ([#56](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/issues/56), [#61](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/issues/61))

### Fixed

- Explained login, network, HTTP, and response-format failures in tray tooltips and account status. Logged malformed Claude usage responses without silently invoking the Messages API fallback, and updated sign-in guidance for desktop and CLI users. ([#72](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/issues/72))

## [2.12.42] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- Published usage as each provider or account responds, allowing faster providers to appear while others refresh credentials or wait on network requests. Pending readings are preserved, and the dashboard receives partial updates too.
- Moved paused credential checks onto the poll worker so local credential reads and WSL probes cannot block the widget's window procedure. Manual refreshes queued during a check are preserved.
- Isolated test settings, usage caches, themes, and context menus in temporary directories per test thread, preventing tests from changing the real application data or interfering with each other.
- Restored the dashboard GitHub link, which stopped opening after the eframe update in `2.8.16`, by using the Windows browser opener shared with widget links.
- Detected Claude desktop credentials from Microsoft Store installations and preferred tokens carrying both usage-related scopes. Preserved newer token-cache support, credential-change watching, and explicit account selection.

## [2.12.41] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- Reduced widget jitter during tray icon updates and shell animations by waiting 80 ms after the last tray location event before repositioning. ([#107](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/107))
- Routed watchdog tray geometry changes through the same delay so they cannot trigger an immediate reposition and cancel a pending tray update.

## [2.12.40] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- Preserved the taskbar's logical host dimensions when widgets are dragged or automatically undocked, preventing custom themes using `host.height` from expanding to the full screen height. Child layout uses the same dimensions, with floating-card padding kept outside the content.
- Saved floating host dimensions per theme and root across restarts and repeated drags, and used the destination monitor's DPI when sizing a dropped widget. Re-docking adopts the destination taskbar's dimensions; themes authored as floating retain monitor-based sizing.
- Retained the last valid taskbar geometry during auto-hide or temporary taskbar removal, with a compact fallback when no taskbar dimensions are available for undocking.
- Fixed missed automatic undocking on Windows 11 by measuring actual taskbar controls instead of legacy container bounds. Collision and return checks account for widgets on either side of centred buttons, separate button groups and rows, vertical taskbars, monitor offsets, and DPI scaling.
- Kept taskbar accessibility queries off the UI and Explorer watchdog threads, ignored unavailable or stale measurements, and rechecked queued transitions before moving the widget. Automatic return preserves the original position and waits for clearance from app buttons on both sides.
- Allowed docking into measured gaps on either side of taskbar buttons and corrected saved offsets for gaps left of centred buttons, preventing the widget from jumping toward the tray after a drop.

## [2.12.39] - 2026-09-19

### Added

- Dashboard version button with a refresh icon to check for updates, changing to a download icon and version tooltip when an update is available. Uses the existing update prompts and portable EXE or WinGet installation flow.

### Changed

- Synchronized dashboard update status with the running monitor, disabled the version button while updates are busy, and resolved unsaved theme edits before starting an update action.

### Fixed

- Prevented repeated WinGet update launches while an update is starting.

## [2.12.38] - 2026-09-19

### Added

- Project changelog covering version history from `1.0.0` onward, with GitHub comparison links.
- [User guide](USER_GUIDE.md) covering theme duplication and customisation, saving and Live apply, provider selection, refresh settings, and usage direction.

### Changed

- Linked the user guide and changelog from the README.

## [2.12.37] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- Prevented widget flicker during routine rendering and theme updates by preserving layered DWM surfaces.
- Restored correct taskbar visibility after re-docking by rebinding layered surfaces only after successful parent changes.

## [2.12.36] - 2026-09-19

### Changed

- Made diagnostics logging optional, stopping recording and closing log files when disabled.
- Simplified the Diagnostics page with settings-style sections, icon controls, and a follow toggle; moved the app version beside the GitHub link.
- Preserved raw log output while displaying local dates and times in the viewer.

## [2.12.35] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- Accepted OpenCode Go console-session cookies without incorrectly prefixing them with `auth=`; preserved full Cookie headers and legacy raw tokens. Updated setup instructions. ([#102](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/issues/102))

## [2.12.34] - 2026-09-18

### Added

- Live Diagnostics page with app version, refresh tracing, and copy/pause controls.

### Fixed

- Preserved Claude usage and HTTP failure status across dashboard reloads by correcting cache validation.
- Reported refresh requests that could not reach the running monitor.

## [2.12.33] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- Displayed Claude HTTP failures in account status and cleared them after successful polling.
- Preserved cached status, stale usage, and authentication recovery, including when accounts are renamed.

## [2.12.32] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- Resolved taskbars to the correct monitors, kept restored floating widgets on screen, and checked the full saved docking rectangle before re-docking.
- Corrected vertical docking geometry and placement overrides for themes with custom anchors and offsets.
- Synchronized fullscreen visibility checks and isolated the primary widget's window state from mirrored widgets.

## [2.12.31] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- Restored Claude desktop usage with support for the desktop app's `oauth:tokenCacheV2` format. ([#104](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/104))
- Allowed default-path Claude profiles to fall back to desktop credentials and detect desktop login or token rotation, while keeping custom `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` accounts isolated.

## [2.12.30] - 2026-09-18

### Added

- Free widget dragging, magnetic docking, and saved placement across monitors.
- Automatic floating when taskbar space runs out and re-docking when space returns, with padded floating cards.

### Fixed

- Repositioned the docked widget as notification icons appear or disappear.
- Corrected first-drag flashes, secondary-monitor and high-DPI placement, drag capture transitions, and false collision loops.
- Prevented left-edge clipping in automatically floating cards while preserving compact docked dimensions.

## [2.11.29] - 2026-09-17

### Fixed

- Restored OpenCode Go polling after its console migration by using the console JSON status API with workspace context. ([#102](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/issues/102))
- Calculated rolling, weekly, and monthly usage from the new meters while preserving absolute reset times; updated provider setup instructions.

## [2.11.28] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- Multiple named Claude Code and Codex accounts with independent usage, credentials, status, and default-account selection.
- Account-specific theme bindings, custom credential paths, and `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` support. ([#75](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/issues/75))
- Custom refresh intervals in minutes, synchronized between Settings and context menus.

### Fixed

- Preserved unique account IDs after deletion and validated account theme bindings without requiring live data.
- Restored authentication recovery and notifications independently for each account.

## [2.10.27] - 2026-09-15

### Added

- Compact Fluent Quad built-in theme, with support for the selected usage direction.

## [2.10.26] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed

- Prevented taskbar-position queries from hanging when Explorer stops responding. ([#98](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/98))
- Improved taskbar recovery after Explorer restarts by checking surviving window parents, re-docking, and repainting without entering a relaunch loop.

## [2.10.25] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- Conditional context-menu `Render` expressions, Theme Studio controls, and live preview filtering. ([#96](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/issues/96))

### Fixed

- Tracked whether providers actually report each usage window, even when usage is zero or reset times are absent, including cached readings.
- Preserved idle Codex session windows instead of replacing them with weekly usage.
- Made monthly theme variables and labels validate without live provider data.

## [2.10.24] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- Deferred tray callbacks and restored the dashboard asynchronously to prevent locking problems during tray interactions. ([#94](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/issues/94))

## [2.10.23] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- **Settings > Display > Usage direction** option to show either used or remaining allowance, with Used as the default. ([#93](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/93))
- Explicit `.display` theme bindings and Theme Studio helpers; updated Classic bars, summaries, and tray badges to follow the setting.

### Fixed

- Kept existing percentage bindings, usage summaries, and warning thresholds backward compatible; custom themes opt in to the new display direction.
- Kept tray badge sizing and severity colors correct when counting down remaining usage.

## [2.10.22] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- Prevented tray context-menu deadlocks by caching theme host geometry outside the application state lock. ([#92](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/issues/92))
- Refreshed cached layout after shell and display changes while preserving live Theme Studio sizing.

## [2.10.21] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- Kept the dashboard readable in Windows light app mode by consistently applying its dark theme. ([#91](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/issues/91))

## [2.10.20] - 2026-09-08

### Changed

- Streamlined the README around installation, usage, provider setup, privacy, troubleshooting, and source builds.

## [2.10.19] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- Thai localization, including integration with the language catalogue. ([#88](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/88))

## [2.9.19] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- Preserved the last valid usage values during transient polling failures, including when every provider fails.
- Kept authentication failures and failures without cached data in an explicit error state.

## [2.8.16] - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- Raised the minimum supported Rust version to **1.95**.
- Updated HTTP, Windows, UI, archive, TOML, icon, and other dependencies; migrated integrations to the updated APIs while retaining platform certificate verification.

## [2.8.15] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- `get(this, property)` theme-expression lookup, including the current layer's resolved gap, with a Theme Studio helper.

## [2.7.14] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- GitHub project link in the dashboard navigation footer.

## [2.7.13] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- Localized local and UTC date/time formats for Theme Studio timestamps.
- Live clock variables, with theme refreshes matched to the displayed time precision.

## [2.6.13] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- Quoted string results from `if()` in Theme Studio text expressions, while keeping geometry and other numeric fields numeric-only.

## [2.5.13] - 2026-08-21

### Changed

- Reused HTTP connections and polled providers concurrently with a bounded worker count and deterministic results.

## [2.5.12] - 2026-08-21

### Changed

- Skipped window-state polling for themes without floating surfaces and avoided redundant floating-window visibility updates.

## [2.5.11] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- Validated provider reset timestamps before conversion and correctly applied ISO 8601 timezone offsets.

## [2.5.10] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- Prevented stale reset data from triggering repeated polls and bounded refresh requests queued during an active poll.

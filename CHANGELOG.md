# Changelog

Notable changes to Claude Code Usage Monitor are documented here, newest first.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), with
changes grouped into Added, Changed, Fixed, and Removed where applicable.

## [2.13.43] - 2026-09-21

### Added

- Exposed Claude usage API quotas and legacy optional limits to custom themes, including named model bindings, active scoped limits, reset timers, account-specific data, and discovered values under Claude Code in the Theme Studio text and expression editors. Built-in themes and headline values remain unchanged. ([#56](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/issues/56), [#61](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/issues/61))

### Fixed

- Explained login, network, HTTP, and response-format failures in tray tooltips and account status. Logged malformed Claude usage responses without silently invoking the Messages API fallback, and updated sign-in guidance for desktop and CLI users. ([#72](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/issues/72))

## [2.12.42] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- Published usage as each provider or account responds, allowing faster providers to appear while others refresh credentials or wait on network requests. Pending readings are preserved, and the dashboard receives partial updates too.
- Moved paused credential checks onto the poll worker so local credential reads and WSL probes cannot block the widget's window procedure. Manual refreshes queued during a check are preserved.
- Isolated test settings, usage caches, themes, and context menus in temporary directories per test thread, preventing tests from changing the real application data or interfering with each other.
- Restored the dashboard GitHub link, which stopped opening after the eframe update in `2.8.16`, by using the Windows browser opener shared with widget links.
- Detected Claude desktop credentials from Microsoft Store installations and preferred tokens carrying both usage-related scopes. Preserved newer token-cache support, credential-change watching, and explicit account selection.

## [2.12.41] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- Reduced widget jitter during tray icon updates and shell animations by waiting 80 ms after the last tray location event before repositioning. ([#107](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/107))
- Routed watchdog tray geometry changes through the same delay so they cannot trigger an immediate reposition and cancel a pending tray update.

## [2.12.40] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- Preserved the taskbar's logical host dimensions when widgets are dragged or automatically undocked, preventing custom themes using `host.height` from expanding to the full screen height. Child layout uses the same dimensions, with floating-card padding kept outside the content.
- Saved floating host dimensions per theme and root across restarts and repeated drags, and used the destination monitor's DPI when sizing a dropped widget. Re-docking adopts the destination taskbar's dimensions; themes authored as floating retain monitor-based sizing.
- Retained the last valid taskbar geometry during auto-hide or temporary taskbar removal, with a compact fallback when no taskbar dimensions are available for undocking.
- Fixed missed automatic undocking on Windows 11 by measuring actual taskbar controls instead of legacy container bounds. Collision and return checks account for widgets on either side of centred buttons, separate button groups and rows, vertical taskbars, monitor offsets, and DPI scaling.
- Kept taskbar accessibility queries off the UI and Explorer watchdog threads, ignored unavailable or stale measurements, and rechecked queued transitions before moving the widget. Automatic return preserves the original position and waits for clearance from app buttons on both sides.
- Allowed docking into measured gaps on either side of taskbar buttons and corrected saved offsets for gaps left of centred buttons, preventing the widget from jumping toward the tray after a drop.

## [2.12.39] - 2026-09-19

### Added

- Dashboard version button with a refresh icon to check for updates, changing to a download icon and version tooltip when an update is available. Uses the existing update prompts and portable EXE or WinGet installation flow.

### Changed

- Synchronized dashboard update status with the running monitor, disabled the version button while updates are busy, and resolved unsaved theme edits before starting an update action.

### Fixed

- Prevented repeated WinGet update launches while an update is starting.

## [2.12.38] - 2026-09-19

### Added

- Project changelog covering version history from `1.0.0` onward, with GitHub comparison links.
- [User guide](USER_GUIDE.md) covering theme duplication and customisation, saving and Live apply, provider selection, refresh settings, and usage direction.

### Changed

- Linked the user guide and changelog from the README.

## [2.12.37] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- Prevented widget flicker during routine rendering and theme updates by preserving layered DWM surfaces.
- Restored correct taskbar visibility after re-docking by rebinding layered surfaces only after successful parent changes.

## [2.12.36] - 2026-09-19

### Changed

- Made diagnostics logging optional, stopping recording and closing log files when disabled.
- Simplified the Diagnostics page with settings-style sections, icon controls, and a follow toggle; moved the app version beside the GitHub link.
- Preserved raw log output while displaying local dates and times in the viewer.

## [2.12.35] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- Accepted OpenCode Go console-session cookies without incorrectly prefixing them with `auth=`; preserved full Cookie headers and legacy raw tokens. Updated setup instructions. ([#102](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/issues/102))

## [2.12.34] - 2026-09-18

### Added

## [2.12.33] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- Displayed Claude HTTP failures in account status and cleared them after successful polling.
- Preserved cached status, stale usage, and authentication recovery, including when accounts are renamed.

## [2.12.32] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- Resolved taskbars to the correct monitors, kept restored floating widgets on screen, and checked the full saved docking rectangle before re-docking.
- Corrected vertical docking geometry and placement overrides for themes with custom anchors and offsets.
- Synchronized fullscreen visibility checks and isolated the primary widget's window state from mirrored widgets.

## [2.12.31] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- Restored Claude desktop usage with support for the desktop app's `oauth:tokenCacheV2` format. ([#104](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/104))
- Allowed default-path Claude profiles to fall back to desktop credentials and detect desktop login or token rotation, while keeping custom `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` accounts isolated.

## [2.12.30] - 2026-09-18

### Added

- Free widget dragging, magnetic docking, and saved placement across monitors.
- Automatic floating when taskbar space runs out and re-docking when space returns, with padded floating cards.

### Fixed

- Repositioned the docked widget as notification icons appear or disappear.
- Corrected first-drag flashes, secondary-monitor and high-DPI placement, drag capture transitions, and false collision loops.
- Prevented left-edge clipping in automatically floating cards while preserving compact docked dimensions.

## [2.11.29] - 2026-09-17

### Fixed

- Restored OpenCode Go polling after its console migration by using the console JSON status API with workspace context. ([#102](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/issues/102))

### Added

- Multiple named Claude Code and Codex accounts with independent usage, credentials, status, and default-account selection.
- Account-specific theme bindings, custom credential paths, and `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` support. ([#75](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/issues/75))
- Custom refresh intervals in minutes, synchronized between Settings and context menus.

### Fixed

- Preserved unique account IDs after deletion and validated account theme bindings without requiring live data.

## [2.10.27] - 2026-09-15

### Added

- Compact Fluent Quad built-in theme, with support for the selected usage direction.

## [2.10.26] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed

- Prevented taskbar-position queries from hanging when Explorer stops responding. ([#98](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/pull/98))
- Improved taskbar recovery after Explorer restarts by checking surviving window parents, re-docking, and repainting without entering a relaunch loop.

## [2.10.25] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- Conditional context-menu `Render` expressions, Theme Studio controls, and live preview filtering. ([#96](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/issues/96))

### Fixed

- Tracked whether providers actually report each usage window, even when usage is zero or reset times are absent, including cached readings.

- Explicit `.display` theme bindings and Theme Studio helpers; updated Classic bars, summaries, and tray badges to follow the setting.

### Fixed

- Kept existing percentage bindings, usage summaries, and warning thresholds backward compatible; custom themes opt in to the new display direction.
- Kept tray badge sizing and severity colors correct when counting down remaining usage.

## [2.10.22] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- Prevented tray context-menu deadlocks by caching theme host geometry outside the application state lock. ([#92](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/issues/92))
- Refreshed cached layout after shell and display changes while preserving live Theme Studio sizing.

## [2.10.21] - 2026-09-09
